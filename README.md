# Causal Inference & Experimentation

This repository documents my structured work on causal inference and experimental
design, with a focus on evaluating modern AI systems, human annotation workflows,
and model performance.

The emphasis is on **rigorous evaluation**, **statistical validity**, and
**interpretable decision-making**, rather than model training alone.

## Focus Areas

- Causal reasoning and potential outcomes
- Randomized experiments and A/B testing
- Validity, bias, and confounding
- Human evaluation and annotation reliability
- Offline vs online metrics for model evaluation
- Applying experimentation principles to LLM and AI system evaluation
